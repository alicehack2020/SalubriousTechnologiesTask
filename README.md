# Getting Started with this Projet

In the project directory, you need to run:

### `npm install`

### `npm run dev`

## Objective of this task

## 1. Improve codebase to follow standard react practice.

### Hint :

     1. Make seperate components.
     2. Try to reuse the components.
     3. Follow DRY Principle

## 2. There are bugs in the codebase that you have to solve.

### Bug Example :

### 1. App is breaking due to Too many re-renders (calls the handler during render)

```
 onClick={incrementCount()}

```

## 3. Read code thoroughly and see how you can refactor the code and improve performance if there is performance related issue.
